## Core Features:

- Calorie Calculator (Main Page): Users search foods from a developer-created database. Input quantity in grams. Selected items are added to the user’s “Plate” (cart-style container).

- Categorized Food Database: Foods are split into Sweet, Vegetarian, and Meat. Clicking a category leads to a page listing all relevant foods.
- Food Details Page: Clicking a food item shows nutritional data: Per 100g or per unit, based on user selection. Includes calories, carbs, protein, and other nutrients.
- Custom Food Database: The entire database is manually created by the developer.
